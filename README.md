# Unstructured Analytics: Car Brand Insights from Edmunds Forum Posts

## Overview
This project utilizes unstructured data from forum discussions on Edmunds to derive insights about the relationships, associations, and perceptions of various car brands. By leveraging techniques such as lift value computations and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots, we aim to visually and quantitatively understand how different car brands are perceived in online discussions.

## Key Insights
### Lift Values:
- **Strong Associations:** Brands like Acura and Infiniti demonstrate a high lift value, indicating a strong association. Similarly, Audi and Volkswagen also show a robust connection.
- **Moderate Associations:** Brands such as Honda, Toyota, and Nissan exhibit moderate to strong associations among themselves.
- **Mixed Associations:** Brands like BMW, Mercedes, and Subaru have varying lift values with other brands, indicating mixed levels of association.

### MDS Plots:
The MDS plots provide a visual representation of the brand associations. For example:
- **First Quadrant:** Discussions emphasize shared Japanese luxury and performance attributes, especially around brands like Infiniti, Acura, and Subaru.
- **Second Quadrant:** Reflects discussions comparing Volkswagen's higher-end models to the entry-level models of Audi or Mercedes.

## Summary
The combination of lift values and the MDS plot provides insights into the relationships between car brands based on forum discussions. These insights can help stakeholders understand brand perceptions and their associations in online communities.
